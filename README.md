### Tools

### Data Cleaning/Data Preparation
In the intial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data Loading ad inspection
2. Merge multiple data on different sheets into one table
3. Fix the format of multiple data columns
4. Create multiple new columns to complement the data

### Exploration Data
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answerkey questions. such as:
- How is the sales of each coffee per year?
- Which country has the highest amount of coffee sales?
- Who are the Customers who buy the most coffee?
  
To answer these questions, the steps taken are as follows::
1. Creating a pivot table of Total sales each year containing information on the number of sales from each coffee name.
2. Creating a pivot table containing information on the number of sales by country
3. Creating a pivot table containing information on the number of sales based on customers

### Visualisation Data
After conducting data exploration, then proceed to data visualization, with the following steps:
1. Create a line chart for a pivot table that displays sales data based on the name of the coffee and the year
2. Create a bar chart for a pivot table that displays sales data based on the country
3. Create a bar chart for a pivot table that displays sales data based on customers
4. Add a timeline to make it easier to see sales developments each month and year
5. Add a slicer to make it easier to see sales based on the category you want to see the sales for
6. Finally, create a new sheet containing a dashboard or summary containing the charts that have been created

### Insight
1. How is the sales of each coffee per year?
Liberica and Excelsa consistently lead in annual sales, with noticeable peaks in 2021. Arabica saw its highest sales in 2021 as well, while all types experienced a decline in 2022. This trend suggests shifting consumer preferences and possible external influences on demand.

2. Which country has the highest amount of coffee sales?
The United States dominates coffee sales with a total of $35,638, significantly outperforming other countries like Ireland and the United Kingdom. This highlights the U.S. as the primary market for revenue.

3. Who are the customers who buy the most coffee?
The top customers include Allis Wilmore ($317), Brenn Dundredge ($307), and Terri Farra ($289). These high-value individuals play a crucial role in total revenue, emphasizing the importance of customer retention strategies.

### Recomedation

1. Prioritize High-Performing Coffee Types
Focus inventory planning and promotional campaigns on Liberica and Excelsa, as they consistently generate higher sales. Conduct further analysis to understand why these types outperform others—whether it's taste, origin, or pricing—and amplify these strengths in marketing.

2. Expand Successful Strategies to Other Markets
Given the overwhelming success in the United States, replicate key strategies (pricing, loyalty programs, product bundling, or advertising channels) in underperforming countries such as Ireland and the United Kingdom. Consider market research to tailor offerings to local preferences.

3. Implement Loyalty and Retention Programs
With top customers contributing significantly to revenue (>$270 each), introduce targeted loyalty incentives, such as early access to new roasts, discounts, or personalized offers. This can improve customer lifetime value and reduce churn.
